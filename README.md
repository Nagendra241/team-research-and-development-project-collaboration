# # Countries of the World: GDP vs Infant Mortality

This project explores whether there is a statistical correlation between *GDP per capita* and *infant mortality rates* across countries. It forms part of a team-based research and development initiative focused on global health and economic indicators.
We hypothesize that countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have lower infant mortality rates, reflecting better access to healthcare, nutrition, and infrastructure.

## 🌍 Data Sources

- World Bank Open Data
- WHO Global Health Observatory
- Kaggle datasets on global development indicators

## 📊 Methodology

1. *Data Cleaning*: Handle missing values, normalize country names, and align indicators.
2. *Exploratory Analysis*: Visualize distributions and trends using scatter plots and correlation matrices.
3. *Statistical Testing*: Pearson/Spearman correlation, regression analysis.
4. *Interpretation*: Identify outliers, regional patterns, and policy implications.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- R (for data analysis and visualization)
- Git & GitHub (for version control and collaboration)
- ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr (R packages)

## 📈 Preliminary Findings

- Strong negative correlation observed in initial plots.
- Regional disparities suggest GDP alone may not explain infant mortality.
